# Project Bootstrap

This repository is meant to help me get started with new projects, setting up my environment with my most used structures.

# How to use

To use this bootstrap the only thing you need to do is run the following command:

```bash
npx github:aqazix/project-bootstrap kickstart
```

# Roadmap

- [] Add Javascript option;
- [] Add other frameworks (as Fastify, Adonis, etc);
- [] Add ORMs (as Sequelize, TypeORM and Prisma);
- [] Remove the dependency of `npm`;
- [] Publish it to npm (may need to change the name of the project).
